Inject login button in login modules
    Idea is similar to Social Login.
    Create temp Markdown document with template override instructions

Login flow
    Find username (username is NOT mandatory)
        If I am inside a form this is where I look
        Otherwise check previous siblings and their parents until I find a form
        Look for a field with name="username" inside the form
    Ask for the user to authenticate
    Go through the server (redirect through com_ajax)
        If all is good, log in
        Otherwise return to the previous URL and show error message.

Options
    Allowed / disallowed groups (NOT forced groups, not all browsers and especially not all MOBILE browsers support Webauthn yet!)
    Show in frontend, backend, both

Test with FIDO2 key (when I receive one)

Documentation wiki

J4 port (core contrib)
    Rename plugin to Passwordless to avoid name collisions
    Remove Joomla abstraction helper
    Use Joomla's own template CSS
    JLayouts inside Joomla's tree, not the plugin
    Buttons support in login modules and com_user / com_users
    Composer requirements in main composer.json
    How do they handle building JavaScript for release...?
