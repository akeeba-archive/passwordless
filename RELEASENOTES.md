## Joomla and PHP Compatibility

Akeeba Passwordless Login is compatible with:

* Joomla! 3.9
* PHP 7.2 and 7.3

We strongly recommend using the latest published versions of Joomla! 3.9 and PHP 7.3.

Preliminary support for Joomla! 4.0 (tested with Joomla! 4.0 Alpha 10) is provided. However, Joomla! 4 is currently not considered a stable, supported platform. If something broke please report it and eventually it will be fixed.
